# PHPFUI\InstaDoc Library [![Tests](https://github.com/phpfui/InstaDoc/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phpfui/InstaDoc/actions?query=workflow%3Atests) [![Latest Packagist release](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/phpfui/InstaDoc.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/phpfui/InstaDoc)

## A quick and easy way to add documentation to your PHP project

We all document our code with PHP [DocBlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) but we never seem to actually generate the documentation and add it to our project. Why? It simply takes too much time (over a minute), so we put it off till later, and later never comes.

But with PHPFUI/InstaDoc, you can document your site in about a minute (OK, maybe 2). The steps involved:
 * Install PHPFUI/InstaDoc via Composer (30 seconds)
 * Run installation script (30 seconds)
 * Create document page (1 minute, 6 lines of code)

 Two minutes to usable documentation with the following features:

## PHPFUI/InstaDoc Features
 * Always up to date, even with code that is not yet checked in
 * Send constructor information including parameters and default values to clipboard
 * Child and Parent class hierarchy clearly displayed and accessable
 * Quick access to highlighted PHP source with user selectable highlighting
 * Quick access to the file's git history for the local repo
 * Full support for @inheritDoc tag so child method docs are displayed correctly
 * Documents all projects loaded via Composer automatically
 * Tabbed documentation so you are not looking at irrelevant methods
 * Alphabetized everything, no more searching unalphabetized pages!
 * Support for markdown and custom markdown pages
 * Ability to generate static html files for high volume sites
 * Add any local repo directories
 * Remove any Composer project you don't care about
 * 5+ line config compatible with all PHP frameworks, or standalone
 * Uses [Foundation CSS framework](https://get.foundation) for a great experience on mobile

### Install PHPFUI/InstaDoc (requires PHP >= 7.4)
```
composer require phpfui/InstaDoc
```
### Run Installation Script
Once installed, you need to run an installation script to copy static files to your public directory.  From your project root, run the following:
```
php vendor/phpfui/instadoc/install.php yourPublicDirectory/subDirectory
```
Example: **php vendor/phpfui/instadoc/install.php public/PHPFUI** will add all needed files to public/PHPFUI, which will avoid any conflicts with your current files.  You can specify any directory by using \PHPFUI\Page::setResourcePath, but PHPFUI is recomended to keep things simple.

### Create Document Page
PHPFUI/InstaDoc does not reply on any framework and can run on a standalone page. It is recommended that you do not make your documentation public, as PHPFUI/InstaDoc will display PHP source files. How you restrict access to the page is up to you.  The following does not restrict access and is simply an example:

```php
<?php
include 'yourAutoLoader.php';

// pass the directory containing your composer.json file
$fileManager = new \PHPFUI\InstaDoc\FileManager('../');

// add your App class tree in, pass true as the last parameter if this namespace is in your local git repo.
$fileManager->addNamespace('App', '../App', true);

// load your cached files
$fileManager->load();

// load child classes if you want to display them, if you don't do this step, docs will not show classes that extend the displayed class
\PHPFUI\InstaDoc\ChildClasses::load();

// get the controller
$controller = new \PHPFUI\InstaDoc\Controller($fileManager);

// display will return a fully formed page
echo $controller->display();
```
That is it. You are done!

### Adding New Classes
PHPFUI/InstaDoc saves the classes to display in PHP serialized files.  Delete those files (.serial extension) when you want to display new classes. PHPFUI/InstaDoc will regenerate automatically if the files are missing.

### Add Child Classes to the Docs
```php
\PHPFUI\InstaDoc\ChildClasses::load('../ChildClasses.serial');
```

### Add a Global Namespace Class
The git repo path defaults to the composer directory, but you can change the path by calling:
```php
$fileManager->addGlobalNameSpaceClass(__DIR__ . '/global/FPDF.php');
```

### Removing a Namespace
```php
$fileManager->excludeNamespace('Carbon');
```

### Add git Repository Page
The git repo path defaults to the composer directory, but you can change the path by calling:
```php
$controller->setGitRoot(getcwd() . '/../');
```

### Add Documents To Your Docs Home Page
```php
$controller->addHomePageMarkdown('../PHPFUI/InstaDoc/README.md');
```

### Set Your Home Page
You may want users to get back into your system easily. Clicking on the top left menu bar will take them here:
```php
$controller->setHomeUrl('/');
```

### Breakup Your Documentation Into Sections
If you have a lot of source code, you might want to break it into sections, so you will need a separate file to store the index in per section:
```php
$fileManager->setBaseFile('SubProject');
```

### Generate Static Files
Just the doc and file pages, no git!
```php
$controller->generate('static/file/path', [\PHPFUI\InstaDoc\Controller::DOC_PAGE, \PHPFUI\InstaDoc\Controller::FILE_PAGE, ]));
```
